Bengaluru House Price Prediction

A machine learning project to predict house prices in Bengaluru based on key property features like location, size, and amenities. The project includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and deployment using Flask and web technologies.

Project Overview
This project aims to build a predictive system that helps users estimate house prices in Bengaluru. It involves:

- Cleaning and preprocessing raw data.
- Performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualizations.
- Developing and evaluating machine learning models.
- Deploying the system as a user-friendly web application.

Features
- Predicts house prices based on user inputs.
- Interactive UI built with Flask, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Optimized machine learning model using GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning.
- Comprehensive EDA with visualizations for insights.

Technologies Used
- Programming Languages: Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
- Frameworks: Flask
- Tools: Jupyter Notebook, Pickle

Steps Performed
1. Data Preprocessing
- Cleaned the dataset by handling null values and removing outliers.
- Applied one-hot encoding for categorical data.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualized data using scatter plots and heatmaps to identify trends and correlations.
- Detected and removed outliers for better accuracy.

3. Model Development
- Used Linear Regression, Decision Tree, and Lasso Regression algorithms.
- Performed train-test split and cross-validation using ShuffleSplit.
- Conducted hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV to find the best model and parameters.

4. Deployment
- Saved the model using Pickle.
- Built a web application using Flask for the backend and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend.

Future Enhancements:
- Incorporate more advanced models like Random Forest or XGBoost.
- Add real-time data updates.
- Enhance UI/UX for better user experience.
